1.	Write a class, Grader, which has an instance variable, score, an appropriate constructor and appropriate methods. A method, letterGrade(), that returns the letter grade as O/E/A/B/C/F. Now write a demo class to test the Grader class by reading a score from the user, using it to create a Grader object after validating that the value is not negative and is not greater than 100. Finally, call the letterGrade() method to get and print the grade. 
2.	Write a class, Commission, which has an instance variable, sales; an appropriate constructor; and a method, commission() that returns the commission. Now write a demo class to test the Commission class by reading a sale from the user, using it to create a Commission object after validating that the value is not negative. Finally, call the commission() method to get and print the commission. If the sales are negative, your demo should print the message “Invalid Input”.
3.	For a  Mobile  Shop project,  create  “Telephone”  class with details like mobile_id,  model_name  and  available_quantity  in  “Phone”  package.  Inherit from this class and create a class for “smart_phone” with necessary details like enabled_5G, foldable and dual_screen in package “Smart”. The customer executive tries to display all smart_phone details (mobile_id, model_name, available_quantity, enabled_5G, foldable and dual_screen) and updates the quantity information, whenever the customer purchases the smart_phone.  Write the necessary java programs to implement this scenario and test with user inputs.
4.	An educational institution maintains a database of its employees. The database is divided into a number of classes whose hierarchical relationships are shown below.
