1. The process of finding the largest value (i.e., the maximum of a
group of values) is used frequently in computer applications. For
example, a program that determines the winner of a sales contest
would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The
salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest. Build a java
application that inputs a series of 10 integers and determines and
prints the largest integer. Your program should use at least the
following three variables:
      a. counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e. to keep track of how
      many numbers have been input and to determine when all 10
      numbers have been processed.
      b. number: The inter most recently input by the user.
      c. largest: The largest number found so far.
Note: Every time the sales figure of one employee is entered, the
application should ask the user if they want to enter any more sales
figures of a salesperson!

2. Write an application that prompts the user to enter the size of the
side of a square, then displays a hollow square of that size made of
asterisks. Your program should work for squares of all side lengths
between 1 and 20.

3. Write a program to compute the following formula.
  e= 1/0!+ 1/1! +½! + ⅓!+................+ 1/n!

4. Using an enhanced for (for-each) loop, copy the content of one
3-dimensional array to another 3-dimensional array and display its
contents.
