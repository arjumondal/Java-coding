1. Write a Java program using try and catch to generate Array Index Out of Bound Exception and Arithmetic Exception.
<br><b>--> Question1.java</b><br><br>

2. Write a class that keeps a running total of all characters passed to it (one at a time) and throws an exception if it is passed a non-alphabetic character.
<br><b>--> Question2.java</b><br><br>

3. Write a program that takes a value at the command line for which factorial is to be computed. The program must convert the string to its integer equivalent. There are three possible user input errors that can prevent the program from executing normally.<br>
    ● The first error is when the user provides no argument while executing the program and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is raised. You must write a catch block for this.<br>
    ● The second error is NumberFormatException that is raised in case the user provides a non-integer (float double) value at the command line.<br>
    ● The third error is IllegalArgumentException. This needs to be thrown manually if the value at the command line is 0.<br>
<br><b>--> Question3.java</b><br><br>

4. Create a user-defined exception named CheckArgument to check the number of arguments passed through the command line. If the number of arguments is less than 5, throw the CheckArgumentexception, else print the addition of all the five numbers.
<br><b>--> Question4.java</b><br><br>

5. Write a java program to create a custom Exception that would handle at least 2 kinds of Arithmetic Exceptions while calculating a given equation (e.g. X+Y*(P/Q)Z-I).
