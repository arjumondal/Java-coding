    <=== Questions ===>

1. Design an abstract class having two methods. Create Rectangle and Triangle classes by inheriting the shape class and override the above methods to suitably implement for Rectangle and Triangle class.
<br><b>--> Question1.java</b><br><br>

2. Write a program to create a class named Vehicle having protected instance variables regnNumber, speed, colour, ownerName and a method showData ( ) to show “This is a vehicle class”. Inherit the Vehicle class into subclasses named Bus and Car having individual private instance variables routeNumber in Bus and manufacturerName in Car and both of them having showData ( ) method showing all details of Bus and Car respectively with the content of the super class’s showData ( ) method.
<br><b>--> Question2.java</b><br><br>

3. Create an interface Department containing attributes deptName and deptHead. It also has abstract methods for printing the attributes. Create a class hostel containing hostelName, hostelLocation and numberofRooms. The class contains methods for getting and printing the attributes. Then write a Student class extending the Hostel class and implementing the Department interface. This class contains attributes studentName, regdNo, electiveSubject and avgMarks. Write suitable getData and printData methods for this
class. Also, implement the abstract methods of the Department interface. Write a driver class to test the Student class. The program should be menu driven containing the options:
      i) Admit new student
      ii) Migrate a student
      iii) Display details of a student
For the third option, a search is to be made on the basis of the entered registration number.

4. Create an abstract class Accounts with the following details:
          Data Members:
          (a) Balance
          (b) accountNumber
          (c) accountHoldersName

          (b) deposit()- abstract
          (c) display() to show the balance of the account number
          Create a subclass of this class SavingsAccount and add the following details:
          Data Members:
          (a) rateOfInterest
          Methods:
          (a) calculateAount()
<br><b>--> Question4.java</b><br><br>

5. Implement the below Diagram.
Here, Asset class is an abstract class containing an abstract method displayDetails() method. Stock, bond and Savings class inherit the Asset class and displayDetails() method is defined in every class.
