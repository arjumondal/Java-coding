1. Create a general class ThreeDObject and derive the classes Box, Cube, Cylinder and Cone from it. The class ThreeDObject has methods wholeSurfaceArea( ) and volume( ). Override these two methods in each of the derived classes to calculate the volume and whole surface area of each type of three-dimensional object. The dimensions of the objects are to be taken from the users and passed through the respective constructors of each derived class. Write a main method to test these classes.
<br><b>--> AreaVolume.java</b><br><br>

2. Create a base class Building that stores the number of floors of a building, number of rooms and it’s total footage. Create a derived class House that inherits Building and also stores the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Demonstrate the working of the classes.
<br><b>--> Building2.java</b><br><br>

3. In the earlier program, create a second derived class Office that inherits Building and stores the number of telephones and tables. Now demonstrate the working of all three classes.
<br><b>--> Building2.java</b><br><br>

4. Create a base class Distance which stores the distance between two locations in miles and a method travelTime(). The method prints the time taken to cover the distance when the speed is 60 miles per hour. Now in a derived class DistanceMKS, override travelTime() so that it
prints the time assuming the distance is in kilometers and the speed is 100 km per second. Demonstrate the working of the classes.
<br><b>--> DistanceConverter.java</b><br><br>

5. Create a base class called “vehicle” that stores number of wheels and speed. Create the following derived classes –
“car” that inherits “vehicle” and also stores number of passengers.
“truck” that inherits “vehicle” and also stores the load limit.
Write a main function to create objects of these two derived classes and display all the information about “car” and “truck”. Also compare the speed of these two vehicles - car and truck and display which one is faster.
<br><b>--> VehicleInfo.java</b><br><br>
